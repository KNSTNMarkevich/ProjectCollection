Web Application with authorization


A web application that allows users to register and authenticate. Unauthenticated users do not have access to user management (they can only access the registration form or authentication form).

Authenticated users see a table (table with identifier, name, soap, registration date, last login date, status) with users.
The table in the left column contains check boxes for multiple selection, in the header of the check box column "select all / deselect".
Above the toolbar table with the actions: Lock, Unlock, Delete (the last two can be icons). User can delete or block
